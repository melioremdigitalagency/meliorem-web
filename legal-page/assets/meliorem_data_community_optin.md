# DATA COMMUNITY OPT-IN ADDENDUM
## MELIOREM DIGITAL AGENCY - BUDGETING APPLICATION

**Last Updated:** 14 December 2024  
**Version:** 2.0

---

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

This Data Community Opt-In Addendum ("**Addendum**") is a **SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT** to the Meliorem Digital Agency Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy. 

**This Addendum ONLY applies if you choose to participate in the Data Community feature.** Participation is **ENTIRELY OPTIONAL** and is **NOT REQUIRED** to use the budgeting application or other Meliorem services.

---

## 1. WHAT IS DATA COMMUNITY?

### 1.1 Purpose

Data Community is an optional feature that allows users to:
- **Contribute** their anonymized financial data to a shared statistical pool
- **Access** peer comparison insights showing how their finances compare to similar users

### 1.2 Quid Pro Quo Model

Data Community operates on a **strict quid pro quo (exchange) basis:**

**IF YOU OPT IN:**
- You contribute your anonymized budget data to the community pool
- You gain access to peer comparison statistics
- You can see how your finances compare to similar users

**IF YOU DO NOT OPT IN:**
- Your data is NOT included in the community pool
- You do NOT have access to peer comparison features
- You can still use ALL other budgeting features without restriction

**IMPORTANT:** Viewing peer insights **REQUIRES** contributing your data. You cannot access peer comparisons without opting in to share.

---

## 2. WHAT DATA YOU CONTRIBUTE

### 2.1 Data Included in Community Pool

When you opt in, the following data from your budget is included:

**Income Data:**
- Total monthly income
- Income sources (categories only, not specific employers)
- Income frequency and patterns

**Expense Data:**
- Total monthly expenses
- Spending by category (groceries, transport, housing, etc.)
- Expense patterns and trends

**Financial Metrics:**
- Debt levels and types (not specific creditor names)
- Savings amounts
- Budget surplus or deficit
- Financial goals and progress

**Demographic Information:**
- Age bracket (e.g., 25-34, 35-44)
- Gender
- Location (city/province level only, not specific address)
- Income bracket
- Household size (if provided)
- Expense levels (to match with similar spenders)

### 2.2 Data NOT Included

The following are **NEVER** included in the community pool:
- Your name or identity
- Specific transaction details or merchant names
- Bank account numbers or financial institution details
- Exact addresses or precise locations
- ID numbers or government identifiers
- Contact information (email, phone)
- Linked budget participants' identities
- Custom notes or tags you add to transactions

---

## 3. HOW YOUR DATA IS ANONYMIZED

### 3.1 Anonymization Process

We employ multiple techniques to ensure your data cannot be traced back to you:

**Step 1: Removal of Identifiers**
- All names, IDs, addresses, and contact details are stripped
- Location is generalized (e.g., "Cape Town" instead of "Wynberg, 7800")

**Step 2: Aggregation**
- Your individual data is combined with data from other users
- Statistics are only shown when there are **at least 10 users** in a demographic group to prevent identification

**Step 3: Outlier Filtering**
- Extreme values are filtered out to prevent skewing and identification
- Statistical outliers are excluded from comparisons

**Step 4: Rounding and Bracketing**
- Precise amounts are rounded (e.g., R2,543 becomes "R2,500-R3,000")
- Income and expense values are shown in ranges, not exact figures

**Step 5: Statistical Processing**
- Averages, medians, and percentiles are calculated
- No individual data points are ever displayed

**Step 6: Privacy-Preserving Techniques for Small Groups**
- **Minimum Group Size:** Statistics are only displayed when a demographic group contains at least **10 users**
- **For groups smaller than 10 users:** We apply **noise injection** or **differential privacy techniques** to prevent re-identification
- **Dynamic Suppression:** If a filter combination results in too few users, the system will not display data for that combination
- **Location Generalization:** Location data is generalized to city/province level only, never specific neighborhoods or suburbs

### 3.2 What "Anonymized" Means

**Anonymized data:**
- Cannot be traced back to you
- Does not identify you personally
- Is used only in aggregate statistics
- Complies with POPIA requirements for anonymization

**YOU ACKNOWLEDGE** that once data is truly anonymized and aggregated:
- It is no longer considered "personal information" under POPIA
- It cannot be re-identified or extracted
- It may remain in aggregate statistics even after you opt out (because it's anonymous)

---

## 4. WHAT PEER INSIGHTS YOU RECEIVE

### 4.1 Types of Comparisons

As a Data Community participant, you can access:

**Spending Comparisons:**
- "Your grocery spending: R3,200/month vs. Peer average: R2,800/month"
- "You spend 15% more on transport than similar users"
- "Your housing costs are in the 60th percentile for your demographic"

**Income Comparisons:**
- "Your income bracket: R15,000-R20,000/month (45th percentile in your demographic)"
- "Average income for similar users: R17,500/month"

**Debt Comparisons:**
- "Your debt-to-income ratio: 35% vs. Peer average: 42%"
- "You have lower debt levels than 65% of similar users"

**Savings Comparisons:**
- "You save 12% of income vs. Peer average: 8%"
- "Your emergency fund is stronger than 70% of similar users"

**Custom Filters:**
You can filter comparisons by:
- Age bracket (e.g., 25-34, 35-44)
- Gender
- Location (city/province)
- Income bracket (e.g., R10k-R20k, R20k-R30k)
- Expense levels (to see similar spenders)

### 4.2 Aggregate Statistics Only

**YOU WILL NEVER SEE:**
- Individual users' data
- Names or identities of other users
- Specific transaction details from others
- Any information that could identify another user

All insights are **AGGREGATE STATISTICS** based on groups of 10+ users. If a filter combination results in fewer than 10 users, no data will be displayed for that combination.
