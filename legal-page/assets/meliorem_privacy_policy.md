**Important Role Clarification:**  
Meliorem Digital Agency is an **intermediary and lead generator only**. We are **NOT**:

- A financial services provider
- A credit bureau

We facilitate connections between users and registered financial service providers but do not provide financial services ourselves.

**Lead Generation Age Restriction:**  
Lead generation services are only available to users aged 18 and above due to legal capacity requirements for financial contracts and National Credit Act compliance.

- Use your data to generate insights that benefit the broader user community

**Privacy Protections for Small Groups:**  
To ensure true anonymization:

- For groups smaller than 10 users, we apply **noise injection** or **differential privacy techniques** to prevent re-identification
- Location data is generalized (city/province level only, never specific addresses)
- Extreme outliers are excluded from comparisons to prevent identification of unique individuals

**Critical Conditions:**
- Participation is OPTIONAL and requires explicit opt-in consent

- You may withdraw consent at any time, after which your data will be excluded from future aggregations
